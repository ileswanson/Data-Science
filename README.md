Here are some of my Data Science projects.

1.- Potentia Customer Preduction.

2.- Recomendations System.


PROJECT: Potential Customer Prediction.

NOTEBOOK: Swanson_Notebook_FullCode_Potential_Customers+Prediction contains the coding for this project during my Data Science and Machine Learning course with MIT.

Here, ExtraaLearn is a startup that offers online programs in the technology field to help students upskill/reskill. From all the leads we are trying to identify which ones will be more likely to register for a programs.
This are the objectives of this project:
Analyze and build an ML model to help identify which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers. Find the factors driving the lead conversion process. Create a profile of the leads which are likely to convert.

PROJECT: Recommendation System.

NOTEBOOK: Swanson_Recommendation_Systems_Learner_Notebook_Full_Code contains the coding for this project during my Data Science and Machine Learning course with MIT.

This project has the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. We have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.
