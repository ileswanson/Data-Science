# Data-Science
Here are some of my Data Science projects.

On the file Swanson_Notebook_FullCode_Potential_Customers+Prediction contains a project I did during my Data Science and Machine Learning with MIT.

Here, ExtraaLearn is a startup that offers online programs in the technology field to help students upskill/reskill. From all the leads we are trying to identify which ones will be more likely to register for a programs.
This are the objectives of this project:

1.- Analyze and build an ML model to help identify which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers.
2.- Find the factors driving the lead conversion process
3.- Create a profile of the leads which are likely to convert
